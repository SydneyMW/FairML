## [Fairness in Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01907.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6 Empirical Results

### Table 4

Rank correlation between **evaluation metrics**

-   AUC: area under curve; measure of accuracy

-   Profit: \$\$

-   IND: independence (between $y, \hat y$)

-   SP: separation

-   SF: sufficiency

"Weak" correlation between Profit and SF ($R^2 = 0.16^2 = 0.03$)

-   $R = corr(y, \hat y)$

-   Misleading figure; correlation is near-zero

### 6.1 Correlation Analysis

Scorecards: predicted y (yhat)

### Table 5

Comparing performance gains from fairness-enhancing processor methods

**Preprocessing**

-   Reweighing: Reweighing is a pre-processor that assigns weights to each observation in the training set based on the overall probabilities of the group-class combinations

-   Disparate impact factor: The intuition behind this processor is to ensure independence by prohibiting the possibility of predicting the sensitive attribute 𝑥𝑎 with the other features in 𝑋 and the outcome 𝑦. This is achieved by transforming 𝑋 into 𝑋 while preserving the rank of 𝑋 within sensitive groups defined by 𝑥𝑎. By preserving the rank of 𝑋 given 𝑥𝑎, the classification model 𝑓 (𝑋) will still learn to choose higher-ranked credit applications over lower-ranked ones based on the other features.

**In-Processing**

-   Prejudice remover

-   Adversarial debiasing

-   Meta fair algorithm

**Post-Processing**

-   Reject option classification

-   Equalized odds processor

-   Platt scaling

## [Achieving Fairness with Simple Ridge Penalty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13817.pdf)

Very technical, don't worry about the linear algebra details

Goal: limit dependence between sensitive variable S and $\hat y$ (without limiting utility too much)

Group fairness; justifies independence fairness criterion

Lasso vs. Ridge motivations:

-   Multicollinearity among features; features are highly correlated with each other

-   Matrix is nearly singular (not invertible)

Solutions:

-   Don't use all features

-   Perform feature selection with LASSO

-   James & Stein: shrinking

LASSO vs. Ridge

-   L1: LASSO Constraint uses **Absolute Value** Error

    -   $|\beta_1| + |\beta_2| \leq d$

-   L2: Ridge Constraint uses **Sum Square** Error

    -   $\beta_1^2 + \beta_2^2 \leq d$

Process

-   Use S to predict X

-   Calculate the residuals: $U = X - \hat X$

    -   These represent X without the effects of S

-   Use U to predict Y

    -   This represents using X without the effects of S to predict Y
