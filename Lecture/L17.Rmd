## [Fairness in Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01907.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.3 Post-Processors

### Reject option classification

Post-processing method

-   Perverse Incentives

### Platt Scaling

Post-processing method

-   Not about ML; general ML issue

-   Some algorithms do not generate probabilities for their predictions

-   Stems from calibration; Method of generating probability for output of SVM

-   May want to generate an expected value (i.e. how much they will repay)

## 5.1 Data

Kaggle credit scoring datasets

Table 2: describes 7 datasets

-   p: number features

-   n: sample size

-   p/n: large ratio indicates overfitting likely

-   Ideally, $p < \sqrt n$

-   Low default rates $< 0.10$ indicate unbalanced data
