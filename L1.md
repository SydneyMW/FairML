## Grading
**Weight:** 
*course grade = 0.60 x Quizzes grade + 0.20 x Homework grade + 0.20 x Term Project grade*

**Breakdown:**
* (60%) Quizzes: weekly, in person in discussion with OMSI submission
    * Example: check the dataset for gender discrimination
    * Measuring insight (not asking about R)
    * Cumulative? building on previous concepts but no
    * Last quiz may be group work (in lecture)
    * In lieu of midterm
* (20%) Homework
    * 3-4 HW assignments throughout the quarter
    * Using data, inventing new methods/fairness criteria
    * Groups
* (20%) Term Project
    * Groups
    * In lieu of final

## OMSI: HW and Quiz Submissions

**COMPAS Recidivism:** COMPAS algorithm was developed to provide judges/prosecutors with predictions of the probability defendant will commit another crime
* A [Propublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) found immense racial bias in recidivism predictions
* See [companion article](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) for technical details 

**Simpson's Paradox:** 
Berkeley lawsuit for discrimination against women
* Women tended to apply to more difficult/competitive programs
* Overall acceptance rate for women was lower than that for men

**Why R?** R more frequently used in data science, aside from python in deep learning
* Fun fact: random forest developed by a woman
* Random forest came from statistical community, more resources in R
