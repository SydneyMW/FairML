## Regression and Classification

**Regression Problem:** predicting continuous variables

-   Linear Regression is a special sub-case

**Classification Problem:** predicting categorical variables

**Regression Function:** unknown function we are estimating

-   Example: height (x) vs. mean weight (y) line

-   Example: height (x1) and age (x2) vs. mean weight (y) surface

-   Each ML method has its own tuning parameters, but all center around the regression function m(t)

**Proportions:** \# 1s / \# 0s = P(1)

-   P(1) \> 0.5 $\rightarrow$ predict yes (i.e. will pass exam)

-   P(1) \< 0.5 $\rightarrow$ predict no (i.e. will not pass exam)
