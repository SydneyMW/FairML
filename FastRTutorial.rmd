## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Lesson 1: Getting Started

-   Install R
-   Start up R (or RStudio terminal)

# Lesson 2: First R Steps

```{r}
1+1
```

### Example: Nile River Data

```{r}
mean(Nile)
```

```{r}
Nile
```

```{r}
length(Nile)
```

```{r}
hist(Nile)
```

```{r}
hist(Nile, breaks=20)
```

Call helper to find out more about a function

```{r}
?hist
```

# Lesson 3: Vectors and Indices

### Accessing elements

Use subscripts or indices with brackets Example: access 2nd element of Nile vector

```{r}
Nile[2]
```

**Build a Vector:**

-   **Concatenation:** c() builds from individual elements

-   **Colon:** builds by selecting a range

Example: access 2nd, 3rd, and 4th elements of Nile vector

```{r}
Nile[c(2,3,4)]
Nile[2:5]
```

```{r}
mean(Nile[81:100])
```

Make a copy of a slice of Nile data:

```{r}
n81100 <- Nile[81:100]
mean(n81100)
sd(n81100)
```

```{r}
n81100[1]
Nile[81]
```

```{r}
length(Nile)
length(n81100)
```

# Lesson 4: More on Vectors

**Sum:** sum elements of a vector

```{r}
sum(c(5,12,13))
```

Interpretation: there are 7 years in which the Nile river level exceeded 1200

```{r}
sum(Nile > 1200)
```

```{r}
x <- c(5,12,13)
x
x > 8
sum(x > 8)
```

**Which:** determine which elements of vector carry a property/meet a condition

-   Identify indices where Nile \> 1200 is TRUE

```{r}
which(Nile > 1200)
```

-   Identify and store indices where Nile \> 1200 is TRUE

-   Then find length of these indices

```{r}
which1200 <- which(Nile > 1200)
which1200
length(which1200)
```

-   Identify and store indices where Nile \> 1200 is TRUE

-   Then find values at those indices

```{r}
which1200 <- which(Nile > 1200)
Nile[which1200]
```

-   Find values of Nile which are \> 1200

-   Eliminates which1200 middle man

```{r}
Nile[Nile > 1200]
```

**Negative Indices**

```{r}
x <- c(5,12,13,8)
x
x[-1]
x[c(-1,-4)]
```

# Lesson 5: On to Data Frames

### Load Data Frame

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)
```

### **Extract from Data Frame**

df[rows we want, columns we want]

```{r}
tg <- ToothGrowth
mean(tg$len)
tg[3,1]
tg$len[3]
mean(tg[,1])
```

Extract subsets:

```{r}
z <- tg[2:5, c(1,3)]
z
```

```{r}
y <- tg[ , c(1,3)]
y
```

```{r}
nrow(ToothGrowth)
length(tg$len)
length(tg$supp)
length(tg$dose)
```

Apply **head** to vector

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth$len)
head(ToothGrowth$len, 10)
```

### Creating Data Frames

```{r}
x <- c(5,12,13)
y <- c('abc','de','z')
d <- data.frame(x,y)
d
```

```{r}
y <- c('abc','de','z')
y[2]
```

```{r}
z <- tg[ , -2]
head(z)
```

# Lesson 6: R Factor Class

```{r}
class(tg)
class(tg$supp)
```

R factors are used when we have categorical variables. Find the list of categories in tg\$supp as follows:

```{r}
levels(tg$supp)
```

# Lesson 7: Extracting Rows/Columns from Data Frames

Extract vector elements:

```{r}
which1200 <- which(Nile > 1200)
Nile[which1200]
```

Extract data frame rows or columns:

```{r}
whichOJ <- which(tg$supp == 'OJ')
whichVC <- which(tg$supp == 'VC')
mean(tg[whichOJ,1])
mean(tg[whichVC,1])
```

```{r}
tgoj <- tg[tg$supp == 'OJ',]
tgvc <- tg[tg$supp == 'VC',]
mean(tgoj$len)
mean(tgvc$len)
```

# Lesson 8: More Examples of Extracting Rows, Columns

Multiple Conditions:

```{r}
tg[tg$supp == 'OJ' & tg$len < 8.8, ]
```

```{r}
tg[tg$len > 28 | tg$dose == 1.0,]
```

Saving Results

```{r}
w <- tg[tg$len > 28 | tg$dose == 1.0,]
head(w)
```

```{r}
lendose <- tg[,c(1,3)]
head(lendose)
```

Specify columns by name instead of number:

```{r}
lendose <- tg[,c('len','dose')]
head(lendose)
```

Logical operation on vectors:

```{r}
exts <- Nile[Nile < 800 | Nile > 1300]
head(exts)
```

```{r}
length(Nile[Nile < 800 | Nile > 1300])
```

# Lesson 9: The tapply Function

In English: "Split the vector **tg\$len** into two groups, according to the value of **tg\$supp**, then apply **mean** to each group."

```{r}
tapply(tg$len,tg$supp,mean)
```

Note that the result was returned as a vector, which we could save by assigning it to, say **z**:

```{r}
z <- tapply(tg$len,tg$supp,mean)
z[1] 
z[2]
```

```{r}
x <- c(8,5,12,13)
g <- c('M',"F",'M','M')
tapply(x,g,mean)
```

```{r}
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight,PlantGrowth$group,length)
```

Mtcars Dataset:

```{r}
row.names(mtcars)
```

```{r}
row.names(mtcars)[7]
row.names(mtcars)[7] <- 'Dustpan'
row.names(mtcars)[7]
```

# Lesson 10: Data Cleaning

```{r}
pima <- read.csv('http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/FasteR/data/Pima.csv',header=TRUE)
head(pima)
```

The **dim** function tells us that there are 768 people in the study, 9 variables measured on each.

```{r}

dim(pima)
```

**Table Function:**

```{r}
table(pima$glucose)
```

Remove instances where glucose level is 0

```{r}
pg <- pima$glucose
pg1 <- pg[pg > 0]
length(pg1)
```

```{r}
mean(pg)
mean(pg1)
```

Encode 0 values as NA instead

```{r}
pima$glucose[pima$glucose == 0] <- NA
sum(is.na(pima$glucose))
```

Mean function does not skip over NA values by default

```{r}
mean(pima$glucose)
mean(pima$glucose, na.rm=TRUE)
```

# Lesson 11: The R List Class

```{r}
mtmpg <- mtcars$mpg
```

Split the vector into three vectors, one for 4-cylinder cars, one for 6-cylinder cars, and one for 8-cylinder cars

Option A:

```{r}
mt4 <- mtmpg[mtcars$cyl == 4]
mt6 <- mtmpg[mtcars$cyl == 6]
mt8 <- mtmpg[mtcars$cyl == 8]
```

Option B:

```{r}
mtl <- split(mtmpg,mtcars$cyl)
mtl
```

Index mtl according to automatically-made split:

```{r}
mtl$'4'
mtl[[1]]
```

```{r}
head(mtcars$cyl)
```

Make copies:

```{r}
m4 <- mtl[[1]]
m6 <- mtl[[2]]
m8 <- mtl[[3]]
```

**Lists** are good for mixing types together in one package:

```{r}
l <- list(a = c(2,5), b = 'sky')
l
```

Change default names:

```{r}
names(mtl) <- c('four','six','eight')
mtl
```

Get MPG for third car in 6-cylinder category

```{r}
mtl[[2]][3]
mtl$six[3]
```

# Lesson 12: Another Look at the Nile Data

Plot data against time:

```{r}
plot(Nile)
```

```{r}
which(Nile < 600)
```

Plot mtcars: Weight vs. MPG

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg)
```

Nile is of numeric type and **time series** class

```{r}
is.numeric(Nile)
class(Nile)
```

```{r}
Nile[55]
Nile[1 + 1925 - 1871]
```

# Lesson 13: Pause to Reflect

One has various tools and materials, and the goal is to put these together in a creative way to produce the end result.

The tools here are the various functions, e.g. **mean** and **which**, and the materials are one's data. One then must creatively put them together to achieve one's goal.

# Lesson 14: Introduction to Base R Graphics

```{r}
load(url('https://github.com/matloff/fasteR/blob/master/data/prgeng.RData?raw=true'))
head(prgeng)
```

Scatter plot of wage vs. age

```{r}
plot(prgeng$age,prgeng$wageinc)
```

Plotting Sample:

```{r}
#indxs <- sample(1:nrow(prgeng),2500)
#prgeng2500 <- prgeng[indxs,]
prgeng2500 <- prgeng[sample(1:nrow(prgeng),2500),]
pe2500 <- prgeng2500
```

```{r}
plot(prgeng2500$age,prgeng2500$wageinc)
```

Color Code by Gender

```{r}
plot(prgeng2500$age,prgeng2500$wageinc,col=prgeng2500$sex)
```

Improve axis labels and point size:

```{r}
plot(pe2500$age, pe2500$wageinc,  # plot age vs. wage
     col=as.factor(pe2500$sex),   # color by sex column
     xlab='age',    # x axis label
     ylab='wage',   # y axis label
     cex=0.6)       # draw at 60% default size
```

# Lesson 15: More on Base Graphics

### Split data by gender:

```{r}
wageByGender <- split(prgeng$wageinc,prgeng$sex)
dm <- density(wageByGender[[1]])
dw <- density(wageByGender[[2]])
```

**wageByGender[[1]]** will now be the vector of men's wages, and similarly **wageByGender[[2]]** will have the women's wages.

```{r}
plot(dw,col='red')
points(dm,cex=0.2)
```

Call plot and then points: calling **plot** twice would destroy the first plot; we merely want to *add points* to the existing graph.
Plot women's data first: the women's curve is taller, so if we plotted the men first, part of the women's curve would be cut off.

# Lesson 16: Writing Your Own Functions

Computing the mean of a vector:

```{r}
mean(Nile[Nile > 1200])
```

Broken down into 3 steps:

```{r}
gt1200Indices <- which(Nile > 1200)
nileSubsetGT1200 <- Nile[gt1200Indices]
mean(nileSubsetGT1200)
```

Steps:

1.  In line 1, we find the indices in **Nile** for the elements larger than 1200.
2.  In line 2, we extract the subset of **Nile** consisting of those elements.
3.  In line 3, we compute the desired mean.

### Writing a Function:

```{r}
mgd <- function(x,d) return(mean(x[x > d]))
```

The return is not needed here, since in any function, **R will return the last value computed,** in this case the requested mean.

```{r}
mgd <- function(x,d) mean(x[x > d])
```

**Formal Arguments:**

-   x: vector

-   d: value with which to subset vector x with x[x \> d]

### Saving an R Object:

```{r}
save(mgd,file='mean_greater_than_d')
```

### Accessing an R Object:

```{r}
load('mean_greater_than_d')
```

### Writing a Range Function:

```{r}
rng <- function(y) max(y) - min(y)
rng(Nile)
```

# Lesson 17: For Loops

### For Loop Example

Manually fill in 0s as NA in glucose column

```{r}
pima$glucose[pima$glucose == 0] <- NA
```

Find and print all 0 values in all columns of pima dataset

```{r}
for (i in 1:9) print(sum(pima[,i] == 0))
```

```{r}
for (colNumber in 1:9) print(sum(pima[,colNumber] == 0))
```

```{r}
colnames(pima)
```

Use for loop to fill in 0s as NA in appropriate columns

```{r}
for (i in 3:6) pima[pima[,i] == 0,i] <- NA
```

Equivalent step-by-step format:

```{r}
for (i in 2:6) {
   zeroIndices <- which(pima[,i] == 0)
   pima[zeroIndices,i] <- NA
}
```

# Break Construct

Say we are adding cubes of numbers 1,2,3,\..., and for some reason want to determine which sum is the first to exceed **s**.
If our accumulated total meets our goal, we leave the loop early.

```{r}
f <- function(n,s) {
   tot <- 0
   for (i in 1:n) {
      tot <- tot + i^3
      if (tot > s) {
         print(i)
         break
      }
      if (i == n) print('failed')
   }
}
```

# Lesson 18: Functions with Blocks

General function to replace 0s with NAs:

```{r}
zerosToNAs <- function(d,cols){
   for (j in cols) {
      NArows <- which(d[,j] == 0)
      d[NArows,j] <- NA
   }
   d
}
```

Apply to pima to create a copy with NAs replacing all 0s:

```{r}
zerosToNAs(pima,2:6)
```

# Lesson 19: Text Editing and IDEs

### Text editing options:

1.  If you are already using an IDE, say RStudio, you simply edit in the designated pane.

2.  If you are using an external editor, say vim or emacs, just open a new file and use that workspace.

3.  For those not using these, we'll just use R's built-in **edit** function.

### 1. RStudio Option

Define function and call

```{r}
f <- function(x,y){
   s <- x + y
   d <- x - y
   c(s,d)
}
```

```{r}
f(5,2)
```

### 2. External Text Editor Option

If an external text editor is used, save code into file such as "a.R", and then load file:

`source('a.R')`

Then run f as usual with R.

### **3. Edit Option**

Open a blank text editor, save text to "f"

`f <- edit()`

Opens text editor with f's current contents, save edited text to "f"

`f <- edit(f)`

Then run f as usual with R.

# Lesson 20: If, Else, Ifelse

### "If" Example:

Label all education levels under 13 as 12

```{r}
pe <- prgeng
pe$educ <- as.numeric(pe$educ)
head(pe$educ,15)
for (i in 1:nrow(pe)) {
   if (pe$educ[i] < 13) pe$educ[i] <- 12 
}
head(pe$educ,15)
```

```{r}
pe <- prgeng
pe$educ <- as.numeric(pe$educ)
edu <- pe$educ
pe$educ <- ifelse(edu < 13,12,edu)
```

```{r}
plot(pe$age,pe$wageinc,col=edu, cex=0.2)
```

### "If Else" Example: 

```{r}
if (x < 3) y <- -1 else y <- 1
```

### "Ifelse" Example:

```{r}
pe$educ <- ifelse(edu < 13,12,edu)
```

Re-code Nile data to a new vector "nile" with values 1, 2, 3 for the cases in which the value is:

1.  less than 800
2.  between 800 and 1150 inclusive
3.  greater than 1150.

```{r}
nile <- ifelse(Nile > 1150,3,2)
nile <- ifelse(Nile < 800,1,nile)
table(nile)
```

# Lesson 21: Do Professional Athletes Keep Fit?

```{r}
load(url('https://github.com/matloff/fasteR/blob/master/data/mlb.RData?raw=true'))
head(mlb)
```

Explore age:

```{r}
age <- round(mlb$Age)
table(age)
```

### Evaluate Age and Weight Relationship:

Split weight vector according to correspondingelements in age vector, and find the mean weight in each resulting group:

```{r}
taout <- tapply(mlb$Weight,age,mean)
names(taout) # display age groups
```

Plot the means against age:

```{r}
plot(23:35,taout[3:15],
     xlab='Age',    # x axis label
     ylab='Mean weight of age group',   # y axis label
     cex=0.6)
```

### Evaluate Position vs. Weight Relationship

Get mean weight of each position

```{r}
position <- mlb$PosCategory
tpout <- tapply(mlb$Weight,position,mean)
names(tpout) # display position groups
```

Plot mean weight for each position

```{r}
names <- unique(mlb$PosCategory)
plot(names,tpout,
     xlab='Position',    # x axis label
     ylab='Mean Weight of Position',   # y axis label
     )
```

# Lesson 22: Linear Regression Analysis, I

### Generate Linear Model

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ Age,data=mlb)
```

### Plot Linear Model

```{r}
plot(23:35,taout[3:15],
     xlab='Age',    # x axis label
     ylab='Mean weight of age group',   # y axis label
     cex=0.6)
abline(181.4366,0.6936)
```

# Lesson 23: S3 Classes

### Access Linear Model Class

lm creates a linear model object, which stores the coefficients

```{r}
lmout <- lm(Weight ~ Age,data=mlb)
class(lmout)
str(lmout)
```

1.  Our **lmout** object here is an R list (which is typical of S3 objects). That R list here has 12 elements.

2.  But it has an extra *attribute*, which is the class name, in this case **'lm'**. (So the designers of R simply chose to name the class after the function, which is not always the case.)

3.  The first of the elements of this R list is named 'coefficients', and it is a vector containing the slope and intercept.

Access coefficients directly from object:

```{r}
cfs <- lmout$coefficients
```

Two ways to plot:

```{r}
plot(23:35,taout[3:15],
     xlab='Age',    # x axis label
     ylab='Mean weight of age group',   # y axis label
     cex=0.6)
abline(a = cfs[1], b = cfs[2])
abline(lmout)
```

### Account for Height and Age:

```{r}
lmo <- lm(Weight ~ Height + Age, data=mlb)
lmo
```

This says:

    estimated mean weight = -187.6382 + 4.9236 height + 0.9115 age

Conclusions:

-   Players on average gain about 0.9 pounds per year.

-   An extra inch of height corresponds to about 4.9 pounds of extra weight.

-   Taller players are indeed heavier, as we surmised.

# Lesson 24: Baseball Player Analysis (cont'd.)

Question: do regression lines differ much among player positions?

```{r}
table(mlb$PosCategory)
```

### Fit the regression line for each position type

Find indices of each position type:

```{r}
rownums <- split(1:nrow(mlb),mlb$PosCategory)
str(rownums)
```

Fit model to each position, store coefficients in 'm' data frame:

```{r}
posNames <- names(rownums)
m <- data.frame()
for (pos in posNames) {
   posRows <- rownums[[pos]]
   lmo <- lm(Weight ~ Age, data = mlb[posRows,])
   newrow <- lmo$coefficients
   m <- rbind(m,newrow)
}
m
```

Adjust formatting:

```{r}
row.names(m) <- posNames
names(m) <- c('intercept','slope')
m
```

# Lesson 25: R Packages, CRAN, Etc.

### Ggplot2 install

Do this any time package needs to be installed or updated

```{r}
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

### Ggplot2 Load

Do this any time loading a new R session

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
