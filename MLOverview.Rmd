# Notation

For convenience, we'll let Y denote the variable to be predicted, i.e.
the response variable, and let X denote the set of predictor
variables/features. (ML people tend to use the term *features*, while In
stat, the term *predictors* is common. In applied fields, e.g. economics
or psychology, some use the term *independent variables*.)

We develop our prediction rule from available *training data*,
consisting of n data points, denoted by (X<sub>1</sub>,
Y<sub>1</sub>),.., (X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>). We wish to predict
new cases (X<sub>new</sub>,Y<sub>new</sub>) in the future, in which
X<sub>new</sub> is known but Y<sub>new</sub> needs to be predicted.

So, we may wish to predict human weight Y from height X, or from height
and age in a 2-component vector X. Say we have the latter situation, and
data on n = 100 people. Then for instance X<sub>23</sub> would be the
vector of height and age for the 23rd person in our training data, and
Y<sub>23</sub> would be that person's weight.

The vector X may include *indicator* variables, which have values only 1
or 0. We may for instance predict weight from height, age and gender,
the latter being 1 for female, 0 for male.

If Y represents a binary variable, we represent it as an indicator
variable. In the famous Pima Diabetes dataset in the [UCI Machine
Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), 1 means
diabetic, 0 means not.

If Y itself is categorical, we represent it by several indicator
variables, one for each category. In another disease-related UCI
dataset, Y is status of a person's vertebrae condition; there are three
classes: normal (NO), disk hernia (DH), or spondilolysthesis (SP). Y =
(1,0,0) for a normal person, for instance. Thus Y can be a vector too.

# Running example

The package's built-in dataset **mlb** consists of data on major league
baseball players (courtesy of the UCLA Dept. of Statistics).

Here is a glimpse of the data:

``` r
> data(mlb)
> head(mlb)
             Name Team       Position Height Weight   Age PosCategory
1   Adam_Donachie  BAL        Catcher     74    180 22.99     Catcher
2       Paul_Bako  BAL        Catcher     74    215 34.69     Catcher
3 Ramon_Hernandez  BAL        Catcher     72    210 30.78     Catcher
4    Kevin_Millar  BAL  First_Baseman     72    210 35.43   Infielder
5     Chris_Gomez  BAL  First_Baseman     73    188 35.71   Infielder
6   Brian_Roberts  BAL Second_Baseman     69    176 29.39   Infielder
```

# The R package's **qe**\*-series functions

Here "qe" stands for **"quick and easy,"** and we really mean that!

The functions have a simple, uniform interface, and most importantly,
**require no setup.** To fit an SVM model, say, one simply calls
**qeSVM**, no preparation calls to define the model etc.

The call form is

``` r
model fit <- qe<model name>(<data name>,<Y name>)
```

As noted, no prior calls are needed to define the model, etc.

## Example {#example}

Let's predict weight from height and age, using two methods, k-Nearest
Neighbor and random forests. (Details of the methods will be explained
shortly; for now, let's just see how to invoke them.)

``` r
mlb1 <- mlb[,4:6]  # columns for height, weight and age
knnout <- qeKNN(mlb1,'Weight')  # fit k-Nearest Neighbor model
rfout <- qeRF(mlb1,'Weight')  # fit random forests model
```

Most methods have *hyperparameters*, values that can be used to tweak
the analysis in various ways. In **qeML**, default values of
hyperparameters are set but can be overridden.

Prediction of new cases is equally easy, in the form

``` r
predict(<model fit>, <new X value>)
```

E.g. to predict the weight of a new player of height 70 and age 28,
using our random forests model created above, run

``` r
> predict(rfout,c(70,28))
       2 
184.1626 
```

Such a player would be predicted to weigh about 184 pounds.

The data is partitioned into a training set and a holdout set, with the
model being fit on the former and then tested on the latter.

``` r
> rfout$testAcc  # mean absolute prediction error
[1] 15.16911
```

So, on average, our predictions are off by about 15 pounds. What about
the k-NN model?

``` r
> knnout$testAcc
[1] 13.20277
```

Seems to be better, though we should try other values of the
hyperparameters.

(The size of the holdout set size can be set differently from the
default, or suppressed entirely.)

## Regression and classification problems, regression functions

Prediction applications in which Y is a continuous variable, say weight,
or at least ordinal, are called *regression settings*. Applications in
which Y is categorical, i.e. Y is a factor variable in R, say predicting
the player's position (e.g. pitcher) are *classification settings*.

Somewhat confusingly, both settings make use of the *regression
function*, m(t) = E(Y \| X = t), the mean value of Y in the
subpopulation defined by X = t. If say we are predicting weight in the
**mlb** data, then for instance m(71,23) would be the mean weight among
all players of height 71 inches and 23 years old. To predict the weight
of a new player, say height 77 and age 19, we use m(77,19).

In classification problems, Y is converted to a set of indicator
variables. For the position 'pitcher' in the **mlb** data, we would have
Y = 1 or 0, depending on whether the player is a pitcher or not.
(Position is in column 3 of the original dataset.) Then E(Y \| X = t)
reduces to P(Y = 1 \| X = t), the probability that the player is a
pitcher given the player's height, weight and age, say. We would
typically find probabilities for each position, then guess the one with
the highest probability.

In other words, the regression function m(t) is central to both
regression and classification settings. The statistical/machine learning
methods presented here amount to ways to estimate m(t). The methods are
presented below in an order that shows connection between them.

Even though each ML method has its own special *tuning parameters* or
*hyperparameters*, used to fine-tune performance, they all center around
the regression function m(t).

The **qe** series function sense whether the user is specifying a
regression setting or a classification setting, by noting whether the Y
variable (second argument) is numeric or an R factor.

# ML predictive methods

We now present the "30,000 foot" view of the major statistical/machine
learning methods.

## k-Nearest Neighbors {#k-nearest-neighbors}

This method was originally developed by statisticians, starting in the
1950s and 60s.

It's very intuitive. To predict, say, the weight of a new player of
height 72 and age 25, we find the k closest players in our training data
to (72,25), and average their weights. This is our estimate of m(72,25),
and we use it as our prediction. The default value of k in **qeKNN** is
25.

The **qeKNN** function wraps **kNN** in **regtools**. The main
hyperparameter is the number of neighbors k. As with any hyperparameter,
the user aims to set a "Goldilocks" level, not too big, not too small.
Setting k too small will result in our taking the average of just a few
Y values, too small a sample. On the other hand, too large a value for k
will some distant data points may be used that are not representative.

To choose k, we could try various values, run **qeKNN** on each one,
then use the value that produced the best (i.e. smallest) **testAcc**.

If Y is an indicator variable, its average works out to be the
proportion of 1s. This will then be the estimated probability that Y = 1
for a new case. If that is greater than 0.5 in the neighborhood of the
new case, we guess Y = 1 for the new case, otherwise 0.

If Y is categorical, i.e. an R factor as in the case of predicting
player position in the **mlb** dataset, we then find a probability for
each category in this manner, and guess Y to be whichever category has
the highest probability.

The hyperparameter k as default value 25. Let's see if, say, 10 is
better:

``` r
replicMeans(50,"qeKNN(mlb1,'Weight')$testAcc")
[1] 13.61954
attr(,"stderr")
[1] 0.1346821
replicMeans(50,"qeKNN(mlb1,'Weight',k=10)$testAcc")
[1] 14.25737
attr(,"stderr")
[1] 0.1298224
```

Since the holdout set is randomly generated, we did 50 runs in each
case. The average test accuracy over 50 runs is printed out, along with
a standard error for the figure. (1.96 times the standard error will be
the radius of an approximate 95% confidence interval.) Changing k to 10
reduced accuracy.

The **qeML** function **qeFit** makes it easier to try various values of
the hyperparameters.

### K-NN edge bias {#k-nn-edge-bias}

One potential problem is bias at the edge of a neighborhood. Say we are
predict weight from height, and a new case involving a very tall person.
Most data points in the neighborhood of this particular height value
will be for people who are shorter than the new case. Those neighbors
are thus likely to be lighter than the new case, making our predicted
value for that case biased downward.

Rare for k-NN implementations, **qeKNN** has a remedy for this bias.
Setting the argument **smoothingFtn = loclin** removes a linear trend
within the neighborhood, and may improve predictive accuracy for new
cases that are located near the edege of the training set.

## Random forests {#random-forests}

This method stems from *decision trees*, which were developed mainly by
statisticians in the 1080s, and which were extended to random forests in
1990s. Note too the related (but unfortunately seldom recognized)
*random subspaces* work of Tin Kam Ho, who did her PhD in computer
science.

This is a natural extension of k-NN, in that it too creates a
neighborhood and averages Y values within the neighborhood. However, it
does so in a different way, creating tree structures.

Say in some dataset we are predicting blood pressure from height, weight
and age. We first ask whether the height is above or below a certain
threshold. After that, we ask whether weight is above or below a certain
(different) threshold. This partitions height-weight space into 4
sectors. We then might subdivide each sector according to whether age is
above or below a threshold, now creating 8 sectors of height-weight-age
space. Each sector is now a "neighborhood." To predict a new case, we
see which neighborhood it belongs to, then take our prediction to be the
average Y value among training set points in that neighborhood.

The word *might* in the above paragraph alludes to the fact that the
process may stop early, if the current subdivision is judged by the
algorithm to be fine enough to produce good accuracy. So we might end up
using only height and weight, not age.

And one generally wants to avoid having neighborhoods (*nodes* in the
tree) that don't have many data points; this is controlled by a
hyperparameter, say setting a minimum number of data points per node; if
a split would violate that rule, then don't split. Of course, if we set
out threshold too high, we won't do enough splits, so again we need to
try to find a "Goldilocks" level.

Here is an example using the vertebrae dataset. There are 6 predictor
variables, named V1 through V6, consisting of various bone measurements.
A single tree is shown.

![alt text](RpartVert.png)

At the root, if the variable V6 in our new case to be predicted is \<
16, we go left, otherwise right. Say we go left. Then if V4 \< 28 in the
new case, we go left again, getting to a leaf, in which we guess DH. The
0.74 etc. mean that for the training data that happen to fall into that
leaf, 74% of them are in class DH, 26% are NO and 0% are SL. So we gues
DH, based on there being an estimated 74% chance that this new case is
of type DH..

In RF, many trees are generated at ranomd, using for instance random
orders of entry of the features. To predict a new case, we find its
preditions in the various trees, then average them. For indicator or
categorical Y, each try gives a prodiction, and we predict whatever
class is most common among the trees.

Clearly, the order in which the predictor variables are evaluated (e.g.
height, weight and age in the **mlb** data) can matter a lot. So, more
than one tree is constructed, with random orders. The number of trees is
another hyperparameter. Each tree gives us a prediction for the unknown
Y. In a regression setting, those predictions are averaged to get our
final prediction. In a classification setting, we see which class was
predicted most often among all those trees.

The thresholds used at each node are determined through a complicated
process, depending on which implementation of RF one uses.

The **qeRF** function wraps the function of the same name in the
**randomForests** package.

### RF edge bias {#rf-edge-bias}

The package also offers other implementations of RF, notably
**qeRFgrf**, as follows.

The leaves in any tree method, such as random forests and boosting, are
essentially neighborhoods, different in structure from those of k-NN,
but with similar properties. In particular, they have an "edge bias"
problem similar to that described for k-NN above. In the case of random
forests, the **qeRFgrf** function (which wraps the **grf** package)
deals with the same bias problem via removal of a linear trend.

## Boosting {#boosting}

This method has been developed both by CS and statistics people. The
latter have been involved mainly in *gradient* boosting, the technique
used here.

The basic idea is to iteratively build up a sequence of trees, each of
which is an improved update of the last. At the end, all the trees are
combined, with more weight given to the more recent trees.

The **qeGBoost** wraps **gbm** in the package of the same name. It is
gradient tree-based, with hyperparameters similar to the random forests
case, plus a *learning rate*. The latter controls the size of iteration
steps; more on this below.

The package also offers other implementations of boosting.

## Linear model {#linear-model}

This of course is the classical linear regression model, invented 200
years ago (!) and developed by statisticians.

For motivation, below is a graph of mean weight vs. height for the
**mlb** data. (There are many players for each height level, and we find
and plot the mean weight at each height.)

![alt text](WtVsHt.png)

The means seem to lie near a straight line. (Remember, though, that
these are sample means.) That suggests modeling m(t) is a linear
function.

For example, a model for mean weight, given height and age, would be

m(height,age) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> height + β<sub>2</sub> age

for unknown population constants β<sub>i</sub>, which are estimated from
our training data, using the classic *least-squares* approach. Our
estimates of the β<sub>i</sub>, denoted b<sub>i</sub>, are calculated by
minimizing

Σ<sub>i</sub> [ weight<sub>i</sub> -
(b<sub>0</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>height<sub>i</sub>+b<sub>2</sub>age<sub>i</sub>)]
<sup>2</sup>

This is a simple calculus problem. We find the partial derivatives of
the sum of squares with respect to the b<sub>i</sub>, and set them to 0.
This gives us 3 equations in 3 unknowns, and since these equations are
linear, it is easy to solve them for the b<sub>i</sub>.

There are no hyperparameters here.

This model is mainly for regression settings, though some analysts use
it in classification. If used in conjunction with polynomials (see
below), this may work as well or better than the logistic model (see
below).

The function **qeLin** wraps the ordinary **lm**. It mainly just calls
the latter, but does some little fixess.

## Logistic model {#logistic-model}

This is a generalization of the linear model, developed by statisticians
and economists.

This model is only for classification settings. As noted, since Y is now
1 or 0, its mean becomes the probability of 1. Since m(t) is now a
probability, we need it to have values in the interval [0,1]. This is
achieved by feeding a linear model into the *logistic function*, l(u) =
(1 + exp(-u))<sup>-1</sup>, which does take values in (0,1).\
So for instance, to predict whether a player is a catcher (Y = 1 if yes,
Y = 0 if no), we fit the model

P(catcher \| height, weight, age) = m(height,weight,age) = 1 / [1 +
exp{-(β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> height + β<sub>2</sub> weight +
β<sub>3</sub> age)}]

The β<sub>i</sub> are estimated from the sample data, using a technique
called *iteratively reweighted least squares*.

The function **qeLogit** wraps the ordinary R function **glm**, but adds
an important feature: **glm** only handles the 2-class setting, e.g.
catcher vs. non-catcher. The **qeLogit** handles the c-class situation
via the *One vs. All* method (applicable to any ML algorithm):

it calls **glm** one class at a time, generating c **glm** outputs. When
a new case is to be predicted, it is fed into each of the c **glm**
outputs, yielding c probabilities. It then predicts the new case as
whichever class has the highest probability.

Here is an example using the UCI vertebrae data;

``` r
> library(fdm2id)
> data(spine)
> str(spine)
'data.frame':   310 obs. of  8 variables:
 $ V1      : num  39.1 53.4 43.8 31.2 48.9 ...
 $ V2      : num  10.1 15.9 13.5 17.7 20 ...
 $ V3      : num  25 37.2 42.7 15.5 40.3 ...
 $ V4      : num  29 37.6 30.3 13.5 28.9 ...
 $ V5      : num  114 121 125 120 119 ...
 $ V6      : num  4.56 5.99 13.29 0.5 8.03 ...
 $ Classif2: Factor w/ 2 levels "AB","NO": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Classif3: Factor w/ 3 levels "DH","NO","SL": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
> spine <- spine[,-7]  # skip 2-class example
> u <- qeLogit(spine,'Classif3')
> u$testAcc
[1] 0.1935484
> u$baseAcc
[1] 0.5053763

> table(spine$Classif3) 

 DH  NO  SL 
 60 100 150 
```

If we were to not use the body measurements V1 etc., we would always
guess SL, resulting in an error rate of about 50%. By making use of the
measurement data, we can reduce the misclassification rate to about 19%.

Let's try a prediction. Consider someone like the first patient in the
dataset but with V6 = 6.22. What would our prediction be?

``` r
> newx <- spine[1,-7]  # omit "Y"
> newx$V6 <- 6.22
> predict(u,newx)
$predClasses
[1] "DH"

$probs
            DH        NO         SL
[1,] 0.7432193 0.2420913 0.01468937
```

We would predict the DH class, as our estimated probability for the lass
is 0.74, the largest among the three classes.

Some presentations describe the logistic model as "modeling the
logarithm of the odds of Y = 1 vs. Y = 0 as linear." While this is
correct, it is less informative, in our opinion. Why would we care about
a logarithm being linear? The central issue is that the logistic
function models a probability, just what we need.

## Polynomial-linear models {#polynomial-linear-models}

Some people tend to shrink when they become older. Thus we may wish to
model a tendency for people to gain weight in middle age but then lose
weight as seniors, a nonlinear relation. We could try a quadratic model:

m(height,age) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> height + β<sub>2</sub>
age + β<sub>3</sub> age<sup>2</sup>

where presumably β<sub>3</sub> \< 0.

We may even include a height X age product term, allowing for
interactions. Polynomials of degree 3 and so on could also be
considered. The choice of degree is a hyperparameter; in **qeSVM** it is
named, of course, **degree**.

This would seem nonlinear, but that would be true only in the sense of
being nonlinear in age. It is still linear in the β<sub>i</sub> -- e.g.
if we double each β<sub>i</sub> in the above expression, the value of
the expression is doubled -- so **qeLin** can be used, or **qeLogit**
for classification settings.

Forming the polynomial terms by hand would be tedious, especially since
we would also have to do this for predicting new cases. Instead, we use
**qePolyLin** (regression setting) and **qePolyLog** (classification).
They make use of the package **polyreg**.

Polynomial models can in many applications hold their own with the fancy
ML methods. One must be careful, though, about overfitting, just as with
any ML method. In particular, polynomial functions tend to grow rapidly
near the edges of one's dataset, causing both bias and variance
problems.

## Shrinkage methods for linear/generalized linear models

Some deep mathematical theory implies that in linear models it may be
advantageous to shrink the estimated b<sub>i</sub>. *Ridge* regression
and the LASSO do this in a mathematically rigorous manner. Each of them
minimizes the usual sum of squared prediction errors, subject to a limit
being placed on the size of the b vector; for ridge, the size is defined
as the sum of the b<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>, while for the LASSO it's
the sum of {b<sub>i</sub>\|.

The function **qeLASSO** wraps **cvglmnet** in the **glmnet** package.
The main hyperparameter **alpha** specifies ridge (0) or the LASSO (1,
the default).

There are various other shrinkage methods, such as Minimax Convex
Penalty (MCP). This and some others are available via **qeNCVregCV**,
which wraps the **ncvreg** package.

Shrinkage methods are often also applied to other ML algorithms.

The LASSO tends to produce solutions in which some of the b<sub>i</sub>
are 0. Thus it is popular as a tool for predictor variable selection.

### LASSO for feature selection {#lasso-for-feature-selection}

The LASSO tends to produce solutions in which some of the b<sub>i</sub>
are 0. Thus it is popular as a tool for predictor variable selection.

Here is an example using **pef**, a dataset from the US Census, included
with **qeML**. The features consist of age, education, occupation and
gender. Those last three are categorical variables, which are converted
to indicator varaibles. Let's predict wage income.

``` r
> w <- qeLASSO(pef,'wageinc')
> w$coefs
11 x 1 sparse Matrix of class "dgCMatrix"
                   s1
(Intercept) -8983.986
age           254.475
educ.14      9031.883
educ.16      9182.592
occ.100     -2707.388
occ.101     -1029.592
occ.102      3795.166
occ.106         .
occ.140         .
sex.1        4472.672
wkswrkd      1178.889
```

There are six occupations (this dataset is just for programmers and
engineers),

``` r
> levels(pef$occ)
[1] "100" "101" "102" "106" "140" "141"
```

thus five indicator variables. The LASSO gave coefficients of 0 for
occupations 106 and 140, so we might decide not to use them, even if we
utimately use some other ML algorithm.

## Support Vector Machines {#support-vector-machines}

These were developed originally in the AI community, and later attracted
interest among statisticians. They are used mainly in classification
settings.

Say in the baseball data we are predicting catcher vs. non-catcher,
based on height and weight. We might plot a scatter diagram, with height
on the horizontal axis and weight on the vertical, using red dots for
the catchers and blue dots for the non-catchers. We might draw a line
that best separates the red and blue dots, then predict new cases by
observing which side of the line they fall on. This is what SVM does
(with more predictors, the line become a plane or hyperplane).

Here is an example, using the Iris dataset built in to R:

![alt text](SVM.png)

There are 3 classes, but we are just predicting setosa species (shown
by + symbols) vs. non-setosa (shown by boxes) here. Below the solid
line, we predict setosa, otherwise non-setosa.

SVM philosophy is that we'd like a wide buffer separating the classes,
called the *margin*, denoted by the dashed lines. Data points lying on
the edge of the margin are termed *support vectors*, so called because
if any other data point were to change, the margin would not change.

In most cases, the two classes are not linearly separable. So we allow
curved boundaries, implemented through polynomial (or similar)
transformations to the data. The degree of the polynomial is a
hyperparameter.

Another hyperparameter is **cost:** Here we allow some data points to be
within the margin. The cost variable is roughly saying how many
exceptions we are willing to accept.

The **qeSVM** function wraps **svm** in the **e1071** package. The
package also offers various other implementations.

## Neural networks {#neural-networks}

These were developed almost exclusively in the AI community.

An NN consists of *layers*, each of which consists of a number of
*neurons* (also called *units* or *nodes*). Say for concreteness we have
10 neurons per layer. The output of the first layer will be 10 linear
combinations of the predictor variables/features, essentially 10 linear
regression models. Those will be fed into the second layer, yielding 10
"linear combinations of linear combinations," and so on.

In regression settings, the outputs of the last layer will be averaged
together to produce our estimated m(t). In the classification case with
c classes, our final layer will have c outputs; whichever is largest
will be our predicted class.

"Yes," you say, "but linear combinations of linear combinations are
still linear combinations. We might as well just use linear regression
in the first place." True, which is why there is more to the story:
*activation functions*. Each output of a layer is fed into a function
A(t) before being passed on to the next layer; this is for the purpose
of allowing nonlinear effects in our model of m(t).

For instance, say we take A(t) = t\^2 (not a common choice in practice,
but a simple one to explain the issues). The output of the first layer
will be quadratic functions of our features. Since we square again at
the outputs of the second layer, the result will be 4th-degree
polynomials in the features. Then 8th-degree polynomials come out of the
third layer, and so on.

One common choice for A(t) is the logistic function l(u) we saw earlier.
Another popular choice is ReLU, r(t) = max(0,t). No matter what we
choose for A(t), the point is that we have set up a nonlinear model for
m(t).

Here's an example, again with the Vertebrae data: The predictor
variables V1, V2 etc. for a new case to be predicted enter on the left,
and the predictions come out the right; whichever of the 3 outputs is
largest, that will be our predicted class.

The first layer consists of V1 through V6. The second layer, our only
*hidden* layer here, has three neurons. Entering on the left of each
neuron is a linear combination of V1 through V6. The outputs are fed
into A(t) and then to the third layer.

Hyperparameters for NNs include the number of layers, the number of
units per layer (which need not be the same in each layer), and the
activation function. Most NN software also includes various other
hyperparameters.

The linear combination coefficients, shown as numeric labels in the
picture, are known as *weights*. How are they calculated? Again least
squares is used, minimizing

Σ<sub>i</sub> (Y<sub>i</sub> - finaloutput<sub>i</sub>) <sup>2</sup>

Let n<sub>w</sub> denote the number of weights. This can be quite large,
even in the millions. Moreover, the n<sub>w</sub> equations we get by
setting the partial derivatives to 0 are not linear.

Thus this is no longer a "simple" calculus problem. Iterative methods
must be used, and it can be extremely tricky to get them to converge.
Here's why:

Though far more complex than in the linear case, we are still in the
calculus realm. We compute the partial derivatives of the sum of squares
with respect to the n<sub>w</sub> weights, and set the results to 0s.
So, we are finding roots of a very complicated function in n<sub>w</sub>
dimensions, and we need to do so iteratively.

A simplified version of the iteration process is as follows. Consider
the function f graphed below:

![alt text](ObjFtnPlusTangent.png)

There is an overall minimum at approximately x = 2.2. This is termed the
*global minimum*. But there is also a *local minimum*, at about x = 0.4;
that term means that this is the minimum value of the function only for
points near---"local to"--- 0.4. Let's give the name x<sub>0</sub> to
the value of x at the global minimum.

Denote our guess for x<sub>0</sub> at iteration i by g<sub>i</sub>. Say
our initial guess g<sub>0</sub> = 1.1.

The tangent line is pointing upward to the right, i.e. has positive
slope, so it tells us that by going to the left we will go to smaller
values of the function. We do want smaller values, but in this case, the
tangent is misleading us. We should be going to the right, towards 2.2,
where the global minimum is.

You can see that if our current guess were near 2.2, the tangent line
would guide us in the right direction. But we see above that it can send
us in the wrong direction. One remedy (among several typically used in
concert) is to not move very far in the direction the tangent line sends
us. The idea behind this is, if we are going to move in the wrong
direction, let's limit our loss. The amount we move is called the *step
size* in general math, but the preferred ML term is the *learning rate*.
And, this is yet another hyperparameter.

So, NNs are arguably the most complex of all the methods described here,
and tend to use huge amounts of computing time, even weeks!

The **qeNeural** function allows specifying the numbers of layers and
neurons per layer, and the number of iterations. It wraps **krsFit**
from the **regtools** package, which in turn wraps the R **keras**
package (and there are further wraps involved after that).

Since any continuous activation function can be approximated by a
polynomial, the outputs of the layers are approximately polynomials, of
higher and higher degree with each layer. Thus they are subject to the
same issues on the edges of the dataset as were described for polynomial
models above.

## Overfitting {#overfitting}

Up to a point, the more complex a model is, the greater its predictive
power. "More complex" can mean adding more predictor variables, using a
higher-degree polynomial, adding more layers etc.

As we add more and more complexity, the *model bias* will decrease,
meaning that our models become closer to the actual m(t), in principle.
But the problem is that at the same time, the *variance* of a predicted
Y<sub>new</sub> is increasing.

Say again we are predicting human weight from height, with polynomial
models. With a linear model, we use our training data to estimate two
coefficients, b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>. With a quadratic model,
we estimate three, and estimate four in the case of a cubic model and so
on. But it's same training data in each case, and intuitively we are
"spreading the data thinner" with each more complex model. As a result,
the standard error of our predicted Y<sub>new</sub> (estimated standard
deviation) increases.

Hence the famous Bias-Variance Tradeoff. If we use too complex a model,
the increased variance overwhelms the reduction in bias, and our
predictive ability suffers. We say we have *overfit*.

So there is indeed a "Goldilocks" level of complexity, an optimal
polynomial degree, optimal number of nearest neighbors, optimal *network
architecture* (configuration of layers and neurons), and so on. How do
we find it?

Alas, **there are no magic answers here**. But various approaches have
been developed that one can try. See the **qeML** vignettes
**Feature_Selection** and **Overfitting**.

## Which ML method to use?

The usual answer given for this question is, "The best method is very
dependent on which dataset you have." True, but are there some general
principles?

ML people often distinguish between "tabular" and "nontabular" data. A
disease diagnosis application may be considered tabular--rows of
patients, and columns of measurements such as blood glucose, body
temperature and so on. On the other hand, a facial recognition
application is considered nontabular, which is confusing, since it too
has the form of a table--one row per picture, and one column per pixel
position.

Where the two kinds of applications may differ, though, is whether there
are general monotonic relationships between Y and the features. In
predicting diabetes, say, the higher the glucose level, the more likely
the patient is diabetic. Though monotonic relations may exist in image
classification, they maybe more localized.

The point then, is that generally "monotonic" applications may be best
served by ML methods that have either linear components or low-degree
polynomials, such as linear or generalized linear models, SVM and
polynomial versions of these. For other applications, one might try
k-NN, NNs etc.
